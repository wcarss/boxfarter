Instructions
============
You're the little red box. Get to the little gold box.
Arrows move/jump, space farts a box. If you're jumping while you fart you will *keep jumping*.
When you get to the gold box, your reward is another level.
If you can't see the gold or the red box, I'm a bad programmer and you should refresh the page.
